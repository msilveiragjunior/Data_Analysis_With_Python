🐍 Python for Data Analysis - Structured Learning Project

Bridging foundational Python, scientific computing, and practical data analysis
A personal synthesis project combining structured learning, coding practice, and clear documentation.

📘 Overview

Every year, I revisit the foundations of Python through focused and concise projects.
In past repositories, I summarized books such as
Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes, Novatec) and
SQL for Data Analysis (Cathy Tanimura, O’Reilly).

This new project continues that tradition — now inspired by
Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition
(O’Reilly Media, 2018 — ISBN 978-1-491-95766-0)
by Wes McKinney, the creator of pandas.

🧠 The goal: learn and reinforce data analysis techniques using Python’s scientific ecosystem,
synthesizing the book’s concepts into clear explanations and practical code examples.

🎯 Purpose

This repository does not reproduce the book’s content verbatim.
Instead, it mirrors its conceptual structure while applying each idea in a
hands-on, modern, and Pythonic workflow.

Objectives:

Strengthen understanding of data structures, cleaning, and transformation

Practice exploratory analysis using pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib

Bridge statistical reasoning with real code using SciPy, statsmodels, and scikit-learn

Create a portfolio-ready artifact that demonstrates analytical fluency

🧩 Learning Approach

The project follows a pattern of active synthesis, not passive transcription.

I will:

Use IPython, pandas, matplotlib and try to use Jupyter for interactive, literate programming.

Translate concepts from the book into minimal, functional, and well-commented code.

Explain each topic in my own words, focusing on why operations matter.

Build a growing set of notebooks that are clear, reproducible, and practical.

Although this repository is inspired by the book, it remains
my own interpretation, style, and implementation.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Core environment for analysis and experiments:

Python 3.11+

IPython / Jupyter Notebooks

pandas

NumPy

matplotlib

SciPy

scikit-learn

statsmodels

This stack covers the entire spectrum:
from data cleaning → statistics → visualization → machine learning.

🧭 Educational Philosophy

My goal isn’t to memorize APIs -
it’s to develop a mental model of how data flows through Python.

This project embraces:

Active recall, not rote repetition

Incremental complexity, building from simple to advanced transforms

Conceptual linking, connecting mathematical intuition with code

Clarity over cleverness, keeping each example readable and direct

By re-explaining each concept in my own way, I strengthen understanding and
shape the knowledge into something usable and long-lasting.
