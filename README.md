# 🐍 Python — Data Analysis Learning Project  

> **Mastering data analysis using Python’s scientific ecosystem**  
> A personal synthesis project combining structured learning, hands-on exploration, and clear documentation.

---

## 📘 Overview

Every year, I revisit the **foundations of Python** through small, focused projects.  
In my previous repository, I explored _**Python Crash Course**_ by **Eric Matthes** (Novatec), 
and SQL for Data Analysis (Cathy Tanimura, O’Reilly),  
summarizing its essential lessons with concise and functional code examples.

This new project continues that tradition - now inspired by  
_**Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition**_ by **Wes McKinney**  
(O’Reilly Media, 2018 — ISBN `978-1-491-95766-0`).  

> 🧠 The goal: build a strong, practical foundation in **Python-based data analysis**,  
> using the core scientific libraries that power modern analytics workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository does **not** reproduce the book’s content verbatim.  
Instead, it follows its conceptual structure while translating its ideas into  
**clean, tested, Pythonic examples**.

**Objectives:**

- Strengthen understanding of **data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration**  
- Master the **scientific Python stack** used by analysts and data scientists  
- Build a **portfolio-ready reference** of well-structured notebooks and scripts  
- Develop skill through **synthesis**, not memorization  

---

## 🧩 Learning Approach

To keep learning incremental and hands-on, I will:

1. Use **IPython** and **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive exploration.  
2. Recreate the book’s workflows using **pandas**, **NumPy**, and the scientific ecosystem.  
3. Add visualizations using **matplotlib** and complementary tools.  
4. Explore statistics and modeling with **SciPy**, **scikit-learn**, and **statsmodels**.  
5. Explain every concept in **my own words**, ensuring deep comprehension.  

Although inspired by the book, this project expands beyond it -  
including additional experiments, datasets, and personal insights.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**  
- **IPython**  
- **Jupyter Notebook / VSCode**  
- **pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **NumPy** (vectorized computation)  
- **matplotlib** (visualization)  
- **SciPy** (scientific computing)  
- **scikit-learn** (machine learning foundations)  
- **statsmodels** (statistical modeling)

## 🧭 Educational Philosophy

This project follows an **active recall + synthesis** approach.  
Rather than copying formulas, I focus on:

- Understanding **how data structures behave**  
- Learning **why operations work the way they do**  
- Connecting Python code with **analytical reasoning**  
- Building intuition around **data transformation and modeling**

Each notebook is designed to be clear, modular, and **immediately reusable**  
in real analytical workflows.
