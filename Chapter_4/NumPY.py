# --- NumPY --- #
"""
Well... to begin with, we've skipped the first 3 chapters of
the book. These we're only to introduce the reader the
Python syntax. Well... we've done this on another repository.
So let's explain what NumPY is:
NumPY is an abbreviation of Numerical Python.
NumPY offers an API written in C that's faster than the
integrated modules inside Python. With NumPY we can
access, integrate, and alter - also do other things -
with it's module. The scientific functionalities, his
models and other functionalities offers advanced resources
that Python alone won't offer. For data analysis, it's
one of go to APIs to use.
Let's show the power of numpy comparing it to Python operations.
We'll create a new file to do it.
In the code, inside comparison.py, you can see how much faster
is NumPY compared to Python when dealing with simple
arrays.
If we did the .append method with a new list, it would be almost 25
times slower than with NumPY.

# --- ndarray --- #
"""
The ndarray is an object that represents a multidimensional
array, it a type and a shape (it's measurements).
Basically, it's a scalar value.
Let's show it in a .py code with randn function.
The randn function generates random numbers from
a standard normal distribution - or a gaussian distribution.
